Setting up developer enviroment

  # Got to python.org to download the latest version of python.

  # once downloaded open up your terminal and run the commmand :
      - windows: python --version
      - mac: python3 --version

  # We then will need to install pipenv.
      - Pipenv automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, 
        as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you 
        install/uninstall packages. It also generates a project Pipfile.lock,
        which is used to produce deterministic builds.
      - windows : pip install pipenv
      - mac: pip3 install pipenv

  # Next download a code editor like VSCode if you don't have one already.
      - once in vs code make sure you have the python extension downloaded.
        - To download the extension go to VSCode
        - On the left side navigation bar click on the icon that has the 4 boxes.
          with the top right box looking like it is sliding away.
        - once you are in the extension search engine, search 'python'.
        - click on the python extension that says intellisense in the discription.
